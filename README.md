# Codeverse Sr Front-End Challenge

This app accomplishes the challenge that Codeverse gave to me, which was to build a drawing app that allows one person to draw on the screen, and another person to see it happen on their screen in real-time.

## How to run

Run `npm start` (after installing packages via `npm install` or `yarn`).

**Two URLs:**

- `http://localhost:3000` contains the main app. Follow the instructions to start drawing. Built with React + Redux.
- `http://localhost:3000/observer` contains the observer app. Everything drawn in the main app will be reflected here.
